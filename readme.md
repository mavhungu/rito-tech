# Project Questions

This is a very brief description of what I have to produce using a single table used to capture details from a telephone system.

The client would like to view the calls by Year/Month/Extension

To make this functional i have to developed the following pages

1. Dashboard page showing a bar graph with two columns :
    ```sh
        a. Number of calls
        b. Total Cost
        c. By Month for the current year Jan - to date
    ```
2. Table below the graph with the following columns
    ```sh
        a. Year-Month (YYYY-MMM)
        b. Number of calls
        c. Total Cost
    ```

3. On the Year-Month Column a hyperlink to page 2 - A summary by month
    ```sh
        a. Extension
        b. Number of calls for the month
        c. Total value for the month
    ```
	
4. On the Extension column a hyperlink to page 3 - Detail list of all calls by extension
	```sh
       a. This will show the detail of the selected month
       b. Title on the page to show Year-Month / Extension
       c. Table Columns
            i. Extension - Call From
            ii. Destination - Call To
            iii. Time of call
            iv. Duration
            v. Cost 

    ```
